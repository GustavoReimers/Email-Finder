# Email Finder App

Note: 
Here is a demo: https://email-finder-demo.herokuapp.com

Here is the master key, if you want to run locally: c63b0de8927bce4813388fc06d55a5d2

Note: I could not check the API response for catch_all value. Free accounts doesn't have that feature.
(https://mailboxlayer.com/product - I used the Free Plan from here. It doesn't support CatchAll detection.)
